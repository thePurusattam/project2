git add README.md - Adding readme file add command helps to add required things to the repository 
git commit -m "commit message" - '-m' is used for adding a commit message It may help us to working on team and potraing my messages to other team members 
git remote add origin URL - This command gathers all the committed files from your local repository and uploads them to our repository and uploads them to our repository we created on github account . Not all files are included in the upload only new files and files that contain changes get uploaded . 
git push -u origin main - This will push all our local changes to git , git push tells git that we want to upload our files and development history from the repository on our local computer to a repository hosted on github . 
-u option will tell you we want to upload the main version of our commits to a repository on git hub called origin . 
origin is simply an alias for your github repositores address on github repositories address on github. 
github automatically linked your remote repository address to the alias origin when you installed github
